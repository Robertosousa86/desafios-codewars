# Factorial

## Instructions

- In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example: 5! = 5 _ 4 _ 3 _ 2 _ 1 = 120. By convention the value of 0! is 1.

Write a function to calculate factorial for a given input. If input is below 0 or above 12 throw an exception of type ArgumentOutOfRangeException (C#) or IllegalArgumentException (Java) or RangeException (PHP) or throw a RangeError (JavaScript) or ValueError (Python) or return -1 (C).
